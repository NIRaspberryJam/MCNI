A library built by the NI Raspberry Jam team that extends the Minecraft Pi Edition MCPI library to add additional functions for use at the Jam.   
Still very much work in progress and builds on top of the current mcpi library.

```bash
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```

The can be installed locally with
